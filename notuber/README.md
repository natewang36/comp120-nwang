Lab #8 - COMP120: Web Programming and Engineering
The Ride-Hailing Service, Part 2
Nathan Wang
'Due' 6/23/2021

I believe all aspects of this lab have been completed correctly. I was confused for a while because no cars were showing up, but then I scrolled out. I freaked out for a bit when I saw 4 cars in the Pacific before I saw on Piazza that the locations were randomly generated. The getCurrentPosition command isn't entirely accurate; it seems to think I'm about 3 miles West of where I actually am. I implemented the polyline 'on click', but was not able to figure out how to remove it after the info window was closed.

Fun fact: There was a randomly generated car named JANET that popped up multiple times throughout the time I was working on this lab.

I attempted to complete the first 'going beyond' option, but could not figure out why my markers were not showing. The code is commented out near the bottom of scripts.js. I tested with console output, and the longitude and latitude were working properly, but the markers just do not show up. I suspect it has something to do with the ordering of my functions, but I have not been able to troubleshoot it successfully yet.

The index.html and style.css remain largely unchanged. All files were made unreadable during optimization during Part 1, so I created a separate repository for a Part 1 version of the lab, and made the code for Part 2 readable.

I completed this lab completely on my own, and I consulted Piazza, the Google Maps JavaScript API documentation, and StackOverflow

This lab was completed in roughly 6 hours.
