I found this lab pretty straightforward. It took me some time to figure out the syntax for a JavaScript array, but after that I progressed quickly.

I believe the resulting webpage fulfills all criteria for this assignment. The only thing I'm concerned about is a favicon.ico error on the JavaScript console, which I've uploaded a dummy favicon.ico to satisfy.

I completed this lab completely on my own, only consulting Piazza and resources listed on Canvas.

This lab was completed within an hour.
