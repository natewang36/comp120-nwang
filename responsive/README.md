Responsive Design

Professor Chow's response on Piazza (Question 48) implied the use of background:url(...), but I ended up using background-image:url(...). I don't think there is much of a difference. I'm not sure if we were supposed to move the container around the image, or the image around the container. I ended up repositioning the background image using background-position for each threshold of screen size.

I completed this lab completely on my own, only consulting Piazza, W3Schools, and CSS-tricks

All aspects of the assignment were completed.

This lab was completed in roughly 2 hours.
