Union Strike Folk Song

I was pretty confused initially, and didn't even know where to start. It took me a while to figure out how to use timeupdate and addEventListener. My lyrics weren't displaying. Then I went on Piazza and checked my code against the Double Rainbow example, and realized I had some errors with addEventListener (bracket placement!) and innerHTML. I also drew inspiration from the pause/play buttons on the Double Rainbow example and made my own, using similar code to the buttons I used for my portfolio (lab 4).

I believe the resulting webpage fulfills all criteria for this assignment.

I completed this lab completely on my own, only consulting Piazza, resources linked on Piazza, and Moz://a, and W3schools.

This lab was completed in roughly 4 hours.
