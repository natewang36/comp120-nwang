Lab #13 - COMP120: Web Programming and Engineering
Security and Privacy Assessment of Ride-Hailing Service
Nathan Wang
Due 7/7/2021

I believe all aspects of this lab have been completed correctly. It took quite a while for me to figure out how to finesse the curl command, but once I did, I was wreaking havoc on that website with the rest of the class. It was really fun!

Unfortunately, the website crashed during the time I was working. I was unable to collect some server-side evidence for some of the issues I detailed, so I took what I could from the client-side (my Terminal script). If the website comes back up before the deadline, I will revise my report with further evidence.

EDIT: The website is back! I was able to get server-side evidence for some of my issues.

I completed this lab completely on my own, and consulted Piazza, the 06_web_security.pdf file, previous assignment pages, and my code from other assignments in this class. I attempted to utilize Burp, but I couldn't get anything out of it other than the website having 5 "low-risk" issues.

This lab was completed in roughly 5 hours.
